# categoricalregressioncontest_v2
Regression model contest for categorical values

This is a competition created for the Data Science Community at Endava BOD

The goal of this competition is to challenge the community's skills and put in practice the knowledge got in the sessions.

## Regression Model For Categorical Features
For this exercise is asked to the participant to create a regression model to predict the poverty probability index. based in categorical features such yes/no answers. that have limited values. The data was gathered from a small number of countries.

## Winner Selection
In a first stage two finalist will be chosen by selecting the participants with the highest R^2, then this two participants will explain the model creation process and feature engineering.

For selecting the winner the model score and the explanation will have a values of 70% and 30% respectively


Note: Be careful by selecting the model you want to choose for participating,when submitting your models, if do not select any Kaggle will choose the highest value automatically.


Note: Will be a public result used for Kaggle for the public leader board that all participants can see. a private score is used to build the final leader board that Kaggle generates after the competition closes..
